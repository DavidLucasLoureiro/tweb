                        As temperatures drop, millions of families forced to flee will face another cold winter far from home. <br><br>

                            In Ukraine, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is providing cash assistance, winter supplies and helping to reinforce homes and collective shelters against the harsh weather. <br><br>
                            
                            In Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Afghanistan, as well as in Iran and Pakistan UNHCR is on the ground providing life-saving aid and winter supplies to refugees and displaced families. We are also providing support to families fleeing the Sudan crisis, who are facing similar challenges for the first time. <br><br>
                            
                            Your donation is needed more than ever now to protect vulnerable families.</p>

                    Ongoing and new conflicts have driven displacement across the world in 2022, seeing the largest ever increase between years according to UNHCR’s statistics on forced displacement. <br><br> 
                    
                    With over 108.4 million people forcibly displaced by the end of 2022, the international community must work together to support and show solidarity with people forced to flee.  </p>
